### Duck-Digital-Forensic-Writeup

Hello guys, I have completed this challenge. In my personal opinion, this challenge was of medium difficulty... Let me tell you how it was done.

At first I used "file , strings and exiftool" Commands ,  but I didn't get a result, so I thought about the name of the attached file in the challenge and searched for it, and I knew that this file is a USB Rubbery Ducky

After searching, I found this useful <a href="https://www.ducktoolkit.com/decode">site</a> to decrypt the file :
After decrypting this file, we got a file with the name : "duckeycode.txt" , And it contains this command :

After This I changed this symbol ~ to this |  , in The Command .

After I run the command in termenal i got a python file named : environ-74399.py
i was open this file and i saw the python code , I noticed that the code contains this URL :

I got this page :

#### here ! I tried very hard to know this type of cipher, so it occurred to me to convert every "X" letter to 1 and every "x" letter to 0
Here I needed to write a basic Python code to convert from x, X to numbers 0, 1 ..... this is the python code i used :

Now, we must decode these output  until we Capture The Flag üí™üèº‚õ≥Ô∏è

haha this is very nice idea to digital forensics challenges , I really enjoyed solving this challenge ;)
